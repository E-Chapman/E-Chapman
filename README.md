Hello! 👋

I attended Le Wagon London (Batch #904, April - October 22), a 24-week part-time intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. Excited to switch careers and move into Tech 👩‍💻🎉 I'm a relentless and creative problem solver and I'd love to join a tech company with real purpose for good 💫

- :sparkles: I’m currently learning Javascript, Javascript, Javascript! 
- :zap: I’m looking to collaborate on as much as I can!
- :crescent_moon: Pronouns: She / Her
- :sunny: Fun fact: I'm fluent in Spanish
